This project uses machine learning to forecast weather conditions. The main script processes historical weather data and uses pre-trained models to predict temperature. See /training for information on how models were trained.

Random Forest model for precipitaiton prediction: models/rf1_temp.pkl
Neural Network model for feature regression: models/temp2.keras
